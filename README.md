# Quiz App 🎮

This is a dynamic and interactive **Quiz App** built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It presents users with multiple-choice questions, evaluates their answers, and provides feedback after each question. At the end of the quiz, the user's total score is displayed, along with an option to retake the quiz.

## Features 🔧

**Dynamic Questions and Answers:** The app dynamically generates questions and answers from a pre-defined list.

**Answer Feedback:** Correct answers are highlighted in green, and incorrect answers in red.

**Score Tracking:** Tracks the user's score throughout the quiz.

**Reset and Replay:** Allows the user to restart the quiz after completion.

## How It Works 🔄

The app displays one question at a time with four answer options.

The user selects an answer, and the app highlights whether it is correct or incorrect.

The **"Next"** button appears after an answer is selected, allowing the user to proceed to the next question.

Once all questions are answered, the app displays the user's score and a **"Play Again"** button to restart the quiz.
